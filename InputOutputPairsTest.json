    "Sports-A-Rama La Sierra High School, the brainchild of Doug Woodard, the activities director at La Sierra High School. Some of the activities that he saw working as a director e inspired him to come up with a much bigger idea: to create an event that would increase school spirit by involving all 4 classes competing in a dozen or more activities. Then in 1983, La Sierra was closed. The La Sierra HS juniors, Sophomores, and Freshmen brought this low-key S-A-R idea with them when they transferred to Mira Loma  and ML improved it by adding Penny Wars, a class T-shirt Art Competition, and by including any & all interested students from each class as participants in at least one event or more. Now it is common to see a sea students from each year’s class compete in a variety of events against each other. What about those students who don’t participate? They become the roaring masses of spectators who are joined by Alumni the parents & staff who fill the gym to capacity. Sports-A-Rama is Mira Loma’s highest attended and most anticipated event of the school year."

Case managers plan schedules to ensure their students are enrolled in all of the necessary classes at each grade level in order to progress toward graduation. Many Special Education students participate in the Passport Program where they receive support and work on classroom assignments. They have access to the library, research materials, and computers. Students monitor their grades, attendance and classroom assignments on a regular basis. They interact with peers and collaborate on presentations and projects. Students are required to use planners which are checked daily. If a student begins to encounter failure in mainstream classes, despite collaborative teacher efforts and after exhausting all necessary modifications and accommodations, the case manager will withdraw the student through the IEP process. A major focus of all case managers is the creation and implementation of their students’ Transition Plan. The transition can include young adult center, community, college, career, job corps, military, Department of Rehabilitation, tech school and four-year universities."
