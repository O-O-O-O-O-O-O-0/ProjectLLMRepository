“We incorporate civil rights and social justice into this project because that was a really important piece of history during the 1950s and 1960s,” said Mira Loma history teacher Sarah Garzona. “We want students to show that these different civil rights groups made a better world for themselves and others.”
On the main stage(in the lower quad)
Recently, I had the opportunity to participate in the AVID Senior Celebration and see students who went to Thomas Kelly Elementary when I was principal, walk across the stage as graduating seniors. After seeing their smiling faces, I had a moment of reflection about just how much support they have received along the way of their educational journey. Our dedicated staff members, families, students and community partners show up each day to provide a safe learning environment that meets the unique needs of each of our students. Your contribution to our collective efforts is invaluable and makes our community stronger.

International Expo was the vision of Mr. Westrup. In the early 1980’s Mr. Westrup,saw the unification of the La Sierra High School students and Mira Loma students and thought that such a diverse population of students should be celebrated. With more languages than other high schools and a richly diverse campus, International Night has long celebrated what it meant to be a Matador; open to diverse thinking. Since the 1980s, International Exposition has continued even after Mr. Westrup retired and his passing.

“This project lets us teach others about history in a way that’s exciting for us,” said 11th-grade student Marwa Toukhy. “It's interesting, it's fun. I feel like I learned more about the 1950s and 1960s during this project than I would have learned in a lecture.”
Pleasantville residents faced a variety of challenges and exciting new frontiers. For example, students demonstrated knowledge of prominent civil rights movements of this decade through informative skits and interactive protests. Social justice groups included the African-American civil rights movement, Latino and Filipino farmer labor activists, the Japanese American Internment Awareness Organization and more.
