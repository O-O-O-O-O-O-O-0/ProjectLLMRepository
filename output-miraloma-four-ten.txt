The Special Education Program currently has over 130 students served by seven different case managers. Students exhibit a range of disabilities from mild to severe.

Many students are mainstreamed in a variety of general education classes. The goal for most students in Special Education is to give them access to the general education curricula at grade level. In the majority of classes the students are using Common Core State Standards in academic and elective classes.
Special Education teachers are highly qualified in various subject areas. Case managers plan schedules to ensure their students are enrolled in all of the necessary classes at each grade level in order to progress toward graduation.

Many Special Education students participate in the Passport Program where they receive support and work on classroom assignments. They have access to the library, research materials, and computers. Students monitor their grades, attendance and classroom assignments on a regular basis. They interact with peers and collaborate on presentations and projects.

Students are required to use planners which are checked daily. If a student begins to encounter failure in mainstream classes, despite collaborative teacher efforts and after exhausting all necessary modifications and accommodations, the case manager will withdraw the student through the IEP process.

A major focus of all case managers is the creation and implementation of their students’ Transition Plan. The transition can include young adult center, community, college, career, job corps, military, Department of Rehabilitation, tech school and four-year universities.
Managebac is the online system used for all things MYP and IB. Students complete all CS/CAS paperwork online via ManageBac.  Once a student has created their Managebac access, parents may request access HERE
Pro-tip: When you go online, please choose carefully what you are paying for. Make sure that you pay the item/fee/fine associated with the appropriate department, club, or activity.

Diploma Candidates take six IB courses of study leading to six examinations, complete 150 hours of Creativity, Action and Service (CAS) activities  and write an extended research essay.

Mira Loma Associate Candidates take four IB courses of study leading to four examinations and do 100 hours of CAS

Mira Loma Certificate Candidates take three or IB courses leading to three or fewer IB examinations.

It is important to choose a career that matches your interests and abilities. Aptitude tests can help you to identify career areas that are best for you.
While many students may use their Speech and Debate experience in the fields with which it is most directly associated - law, drama, politics – many more will instead find careers in science, medicine, or engineering. Among the most powerful benefits of participating in Speech and Debate is that no matter which field a student may ultimately specialize in, the events they participate in will develop confidence, reasoning, and poise. Our team encourages all students on campus to come together. We have a well-developed student leadership team that helps to grow each other's skills and encourages individual success. The team (annually over a hundred active members) is made up of a team of captains to help all students be seen, feel personal development is taking place and that their contributions matter.
The International Baccalaureate (IB) is an honors curriculum offered by the International Baccalaureate Organization, located in Cardiff, Wales.  Students who complete the IB diploma sit for rigorous examinations and can sometimes get college credit for work they've done in high school.  More important, IB students gain a perspective on themselves as citizens of the world that helps them to appreciate some of the issues that face us as global citizens.  The mission statement of IB makes it clear that the program is about much more than just rigorous testing.
The district will also be helping host two holiday food distribution events this month for San Juan Unified families and the community on Nov. 15 and Nov. 18. Details about these free food distributions, along with other resources available, can be found at www.sanjuan.edu/communityresources.
IB Exam Scores can be requested and sent to ONE US College, ONE CANADIAN COLLEGE, and FOUR COLLEGES ABROAD for free. Mira Loma Provides this service via a form filled out by each student. The digital form is available on the Mira Loma Website, and on Managebac. An Email is sent out at the beginning of April to all IB Seniors.

Board hears update on the district’s attendance improvement initiative

Staff provided the board with an overview of the district’s Attendance Improvement Initiative for the 2023-24 school year. Attendance data, post-pandemic, clearly shows students are missing more days of school than pre-pandemic levels (locally and statewide). The pandemic, school closures, virtual learning and hybrid learning had an enormous impact on schoolwide attendance policies and procedures. The 2023-24 Attendance Improvement Initiative is based on the Multi-Tiered System of Supports (MTSS) framework. A major focus of the initiative is grounded in promoting Tier I universal actions throughout the district, with sites creating welcoming, culturally responsive environments and building back overall student daily attendance and connections to school. Strategic Tier II and intensive Tier III strategies can then be effectively employed for chronically absent groups and individual students who are most in need of support.

Staff highlighted the innovative programs and opportunities provided to students this past summer. Based on needs assessments, schools were provided local control to determine what actions would best meet the needs of their students. Through collaboration with a variety of educational and community partners, high-interest learning opportunities for students across the district were developed. The focus of these programs was academic intervention through enrichment with added support for social and emotional needs. Supplemental funding including the Expanded Learning Opportunities (ELO) grant, Title I federal funds, and state funding, provided the resources to over 8,316 K-12 grade students this summer.

Sports-A-Rama La Sierra High School, the brainchild of Doug Woodard, the activities director at La Sierra High School. Some of the activities that he saw working as a director e inspired him to come up with a much bigger idea: to create an event that would increase school spirit by involving all 4 classes competing in a dozen or more activities. Then in 1983, La Sierra was closed. The La Sierra HS juniors, Sophomores, and Freshmen brought this low-key S-A-R idea with them when they transferred to Mira Loma  and ML improved it by adding Penny Wars, a class T-shirt Art Competition, and by including any & all interested students from each class as participants in at least one event or more. Now it is common to see a sea students from each year’s class compete in a variety of events against each other. What about those students who don’t participate? They become the roaring masses of spectators who are joined by Alumni the parents & staff who fill the gym to capacity. Sports-A-Rama is Mira Loma’s highest attended and most anticipated event of the school year.

The Discovery Club program and Early Learning Academy program are the two fee-based programs within the Early Childhood Education (ECE) department. Both programs have experienced financial deficit spending since 2019-20 due to a combination of increased operating expenditures and a state-required freeze on collection of payments from parents due to the COVID-19 pandemic. To support the fiscal solvency of these programs, ECE strives to implement cost-reduction efforts with the least amount of impact to staff and families.

Just as with your first inter-district transfer (see above), you must clarify who is responsible for making sure SJUSD receives the paperwork. After SJUSD grants approval of the transfer renewal request, both you and Mira Loma will receive a copy of the approval. This process can take several weeks and it is always a good idea to follow up at each step if you are not receiving confirmation in the mail.

Once you have received your acceptance letter from the Mira Loma MYP/IB program, you need to take it to your home school district office and fill out an Inter-District Transfer Request. You need to begin this paperwork as soon as you receive the acceptance letter because it may take several weeks to complete the approvals. Some school districts give immediate approval, but many do not. You should receive a copy of the approval in the mail. This approval may be forwarded to the San Juan Unified offices by your home school district, or they may ask you to hand-carry the approval to the San Juan Unified offices. It is important to ask who is responsible (you or the school district) for getting the approval to the San Juan Unified offices in order to avoid unnecessary delays. Once both districts have approved the transfer request, you will make an appointment with the San Juan Unified School District office to fill out a registration packet. You will register for classes at Mira Loma in March.

Proposition 28 requires the state to establish a new, ongoing program supporting arts instruction in schools beginning in the 2023-24 school year. San Juan Unified’s fund through this proposition is $5,734,578. School districts with more than 500 students must spend at least 80 percent of the funds to employees to provide arts education instruction. The remaining funds may be used for training supplies, curriculum, professional learning, materials and partnership programs. Staff provided the board with information about the district’s plan to increase access for all students to quality arts and music education through the use of Proposition 28 funding. The report also shared information about partner engagement and feedback loops used to inform the ongoing planning processes for use of the funds. The full presentation is available.

We are the most active team in the Capital Valley Forensics League. We attend more tournaments, invitationals, and national competitions than anyone else giving our team the largest number of opportunities to compete and work with the busy I.B. schedule that many of our students have. Last season was a remarkable one for the Mira Loma Speech and Debate team we've had students qualify for States, Nationals, NCFL, and TOC tournaments. This year, we hope to build on that success – not just in hopes of amassing trophies at competitions, but in developing communication skills that will serve students and their communities long after they graduate from Mira Loma.

Through the teaching process, we try to explain why people behave the way they do; why society is the way it is; who has the power, wealth, and prestige; and how they got them. We help students understand themselves, the society, and the world in which they live so that they can begin to control their futures. In the struggle for human dignity and individual integrity, we must encourage students to appreciate their own heritage and the heritage of others if they are to have self-respect and mutual respect. We also consider it our obligation to foster in students a sense of civic responsibility, an awareness of the complexity of the search for human rights, and a consciousness of the possibilities for meaningful social change.
The History / Social Science department dedicates itself to the promotion of intellectual curiosity, careful observation and critical evaluation as well as social, political, and cultural awareness for all students.

There is not a team at Mira Loma High School that does more for the mental, emotional, and social health of its students than the MLHS Speech and Debate Team. While we are frequently told that we live in a golden age of information and communication, not everyone is born as an effective communicator. Great students need to be able to think in a manner that pushes them to convey complex thoughts and speak with purpose and control.  It is these very skills that Speech and Debate aim to develop, in order to foster not only presentation skills but also analytical skills that improve their confidence in and out of the classroom.

The IB Middle Years Program (IBMYP) is designed for students aged 11 through 15. The IBMYP is a 5-year program beginning in the 6th grade. Mira Loma offers years 4 and 5 (9th & 10th grade) of the program. Students are welcome to begin the IBMYP in year 4 as a 9th grader without previous IBMYP experience.

Middle Years students are in classes that feature a student-centered approach to learning. All Middle Years classes are coordinated around the areas of interaction - interdisciplinary themes that unify the student's educational experience. Middle years students complete a personal project in the 10th grade which enables them to earn an IB Middle Years Certificate.

The IB Middle Years prepares students to enter the IB Diploma Program in their 11th-grade year.

For more detailed information, contact Ms. Rachel Volzer .
The next regular board meeting will be held on Oct. 10 at 6:30 p.m.
Visit www.sanjuan.edu/boardmeeting for details. You can also view videos of prior board meetings on the district’s YouTube channel at www.youtube.com/SanJuanUnified.
Eligibility: 
Membership is open to community members who reside within the district's boundary.
Mira Loma is not offering other AP exams. We do not know of other locations offering AP exams to students from Mira Loma.
Selection:
Interested individuals must apply for membership and be appointed by a member of the Board of Education or the Superintendent. Each board member appoints two members to the committee and the superintendent appoints four members.
As I’ve taken some time to reflect on the career readiness opportunities offered at San Juan Unified, I was reminded of a student who enrolled in our CTE fire technician pathway. Through her participation in the program, she discovered an interest in Emergency Medical Technician work, of which had not previously been on her radar. Our programs and staff are actively opening our students’ eyes to the endless possibilities which wait for them after graduation.
Our parent groups are a great way for you to involve yourself in school-related programs, but there are other forums such as Site Council, that determine how we use our supplemental funds to address the needs of our students.  We also have a need for a parent and student to be on our safety committee.  This year we will be looking for a parent liaison to support families.  This parent would be paid for their part-time role.  Email me at cpurinton@sanjuan.edu if you are interested in either of these opportunities.

Many students are mainstreamed in a variety of general education classes. The goal for most students in Special Education is to give them access to the general education curricula at grade level. In the majority of classes the students are using Common Core State Standards in academic and elective classes. Special Education teachers are highly qualified in various subject areas. Case managers plan schedules to ensure their students are enrolled in all of the necessary classes at each grade level in order to progress toward graduation. Many Special Education students participate in the Passport Program where they receive support and work on classroom assignments. They have access to the library, research materials, and computers. Students monitor their grades, attendance and classroom assignments on a regular basis. They interact with peers and collaborate on presentations and projects. Students are required to use planners which are checked daily. If a student begins to encounter failure in mainstream classes, despite collaborative teacher efforts and after exhausting all necessary modifications and accommodations, the case manager will withdraw the student through the IEP process. A major focus of all case managers is the creation and implementation of their students’ Transition Plan. The transition can include young adult center, community, college, career, job corps, military, Department of Rehabilitation, tech school and four-year universities.

As I reflect on the positive impact our alumni have made in our world, I am proud of the programs and opportunities that we continue to grow and offer our students in San Juan Unified. Together, we all play a crucial role in empowering those around us to reach their fullest potential.
IB has two testing calendars every year- May and November. Mira Loma tests in May, but students who wish to do a retake can schedule that for November of their graduating year. This means that most retake exams occur in November of a student’s first year in college. This means that most retakes happen on our campus, which means that students who sign up for a retake must return to Mira Loma for two or three days to complete the retake examinations.

In the event that a student misses an IB Exam paper due to illness, IB will allow a retake the following November if and only if there is medical documentation of the illness. With adequate documentation, we can register the student for a November retake at no additional fee. If a student has no medical documentation, then he is considered to have failed that exam and can opt to retake it in November of his or her freshman year in college. There is an additional fee for this service.

For me and my family, the holidays are an opportunity to spend time together that we normally don’t get throughout the rest of the year. One tradition that I love is that we will go around the dinner table with topic cards. These conversation starters allow us to connect in meaningful ways that are not typical in day-to-day interactions. For instance, one conversation starter was, “Talk about a meal that someone made for you”. This simple prompt elicited so many meaningful memories and conversations amongst my family and brought lots of laughs and opportunities to learn about each other. It’s a tradition that I look forward to each year.

IB has a very strict calendar for exam registration. After November 15th there are no refunds coming back to ML for students who change their minds about exams, therefore we can offer no refunds to families after that date. Changes made before the 15th can, under the certain circumstances, generate funds but we usually simply credit funds paid in the junior year towards senior year exams instead.
Mira Loma currently offers three CTE Pathways. Each of the pathways can be started in the 10th or 11th grade.
Most colleges maintain websites that provide information for prospective students. These sites are easily accessed with an online search.

"Dual Enrollment is a program that allows current high school ... students to take classes at American River College... Applications must be submitted to each individual college" (https://arc.losrios.edu/admissions/get-started-and-apply/dual-enrollment-admission-and-enrollment-steps#emailsteps).
SDC-ED students usually have average or above average cognitive ability and can be academically successful in general education classes. However, an emotional disturbance may preclude them from reaching their academic potential. Each student has unique abilities and struggles which will determine the correct schedule.Independent Living Skills (SDC-ILS)
ILS students have moderate to severe cognitive delays and work towards a document of completion, instead of a diploma. Students spend the majority of the school day in the ILS class, and the curriculum focuses on learning life skills. Typically, students are mainstreamed into elective classes to help improve socialization skills. Placement in the ILS class must be through the IEP process. 

WorkAbility

WorkAbility helps special education students prepare for the world of work.  At Mira Loma, there are opportunities for pre-employment skills instruction, job shadowing, paid and non-paid work experiences, and ongoing job-related support and guidance from our staff of Youth Employment Technicians, Jennifer Hall and Sandy McNulty.

This does not require too much explanation, but you should know about my approach to this problem. I tell kids that preparation ahead of time is the only way to reduce stress.

Through Expanded Learning Opportunities Program (ELO-P) ongoing funds, the district can avoid an immediate increase in Discovery Club Program fees. Staff is proposing a restructuring in the fee schedule to be effected July 1, 2024 if approved. For the Early Learning Academy program, staff proposes a 16% fee increase effective July 1, 2024, and a 3% increase annually thereafter to keep up with inflation. With these increases, cost comparisons show that the Early Learning Academy fees remain significantly lower than other preschool programs in Sacramento County. Board action is anticipated at the Nov. 14 board meeting.

The International Baccalaureate program at Mira Loma is part of the International Baccalaureate Organization's worldwide system of schools. The IBO's mission statement clearly indicates the philosophical approach of all IB schools:

The International Baccalaureate aims to develop inquiring, knowledgeable and caring young people who help to create a better and more peaceful world through intercultural understanding and respect.

To this end, the organization works with schools, governments and international organizations to develop challenging programs of international education and rigorous assessment.

These programs encourage students across the world to become active, compassionate and lifelong learners who understand that other people, with their differences, can also be right. (www.ibo.org)

The IBO offers three distinct programs: Primary Years, Middle Years and Diploma Years. At Mira Loma, we offer both the Middle Years Program (MYP) and the Diploma Program (DP).

Professional learning and collaboration designed and implemented to support general and special education practitioners in our schools were also discussed. The full presentation is available.
The Mira Loma Mathematics Department offers students a high quality mathematics program designed to prepare them to choose from a full range of career paths. We offer a rigorous and challenging mathematics program for every student—a complete program that reflects a balance of computational and procedural basic skills, conceptual understanding, and problem solving. This is predicated on the belief that proficiency in mathematics is a consequence of sustained student effort and effective instruction. All students are capable of understanding mathematics, given the opportunities and encouragement to do so. The Mathematics Department philosophy is in alignment with the Mathematics Framework for California Public Schools, published by the California Department of Education.

Some easy things you can do:
IB requires that the proctors (aka invigilators) are provided by the school for every IB Diploma exam. The ratio is 1 proctor for every 20 students, and proctors are there to ensure that the IB testing protocols are observed. Because we do not have enough faculty members to proctor every test paper, we use parents as volunteers. Each parent volunteer has to take time off from work and make specific arrangements to give up two to four hours for any given exam paper.

The board held a public hearing and adopted a resolution stating that each pupil in each school in the district has sufficient textbooks and instructional materials in each subject that are consistent with the content and cycles of the curriculum framework adopted by the state board.
IB publishes the exam calendar about 18 months in advance for every exam session. The tests are to be given only on specific dates during the morning or afternoon testing sessions. The School Principal, IB Diploma Coordinator, and San Juan Unified School District Office have no authority to change the date of an IB Exam. In the case of a school wide emergency or tragedy, IB will allow students to test in the next exam session, which is always November of that testing year.
